# Blog App and CV site

- Main focus, somewhere to blog and host a CV page for applying to jobs
- Demonstrate ability with React.js 
- Add pages demonstrating other tech or functions


### Ideas for future:

- Look at WebGL for a solar system walk through page
- Guide to front end TDD with Cypress / Testing Library
- Other guides of stuff I can think of later...
